## Flask CPU Meater
This app is a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of app development using html and css for the user interface, python for creating the api endpoints, and javascript for calling the api. 

### To set up in IDE:
1. cd into directory
2. run "ReRunEnv.bat" file
3. in your environment, ensure the interpreter is using the path to the python.exe file in the newly created env\Scripts folder
4. Re-open terminal
5. run app with "py app.py". If you want to run in browser on port 5000, instead enter "py app.py b"
